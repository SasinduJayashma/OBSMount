OBS Drive Mount  –  Next Steps
======================================

✓ Installation Directory
    The OBS Drive Mount was installed in:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\OBSDrive\

✓ Managing the OBS Drive Mount
    • Starts Automatically: The OBS Drive is configured to start automatically
      when you log into Windows. It runs silently in the background using
      the "OBS Drive Mount" shortcut in your Startup folder, which launches
      mount.cmd via runhidden.vbs.

    • Stopping/Unmounting the Drive: To stop the OBS Drive and unmount it,
      run the "unmount.cmd" script located in the installation directory:
      C:\Program Files (x86)\OBSDrive\unmount.cmd
      (You can create a desktop shortcut to unmount.cmd for easier access).

    • Manually Restarting the Mount: If you have unmounted the drive and wish
      to restart it without signing out and back in, you can run the
      "runhidden.vbs" script from the installation directory:
      C:\Program Files (x86)\OBSDrive\runhidden.vbs

✓ Changing Drive Letter, Bucket, Keys, or Other Settings
    Configuration settings are stored in "obs-config.ini". To change them:

    1. Open the configuration file in a text editor (like Notepad).
       You may need Administrator privileges to save changes to this file.
       File path: C:\Program Files (x86)\OBSDrive\obs-config.ini

    2. Edit the desired lines, for example:
       drive=
       bucket=
       ak=
       sk=
       endpoint=
       region=

    3. Save the "obs-config.ini" file.

    4. Apply the new settings:
       a. First, stop the currently running mount by executing:
          C:\Program Files (x86)\OBSDrive\unmount.cmd
       b. The new settings will be used the next time the mount starts.
          This happens automatically when you sign out of Windows and then
          sign back in.
       c. Alternatively, to apply changes immediately after unmounting,
          manually restart the mount by running:
          C:\Program Files (x86)\OBSDrive\runhidden.vbs

✓ Log Files
    • Runtime Log (for mount activity, errors, etc.):
      %LOCALAPPDATA%\rclone\mount.log
      (You can paste this path into File Explorer's address bar)

    • Setup Log (created by the installer):
      %LOCALAPPDATA%\rclone\mount_setup.log
      (This path might vary depending on how the setup was launched or if
      logging was enabled for the installer. If not found, check Inno Setup's
      default log locations like the {tmp} folder during installation if needed.)

✓ How to Uninstall
    • Go to Windows Settings ► Apps ► find “OBS Drive Mount” ► Uninstall.
    • Alternatively, run “Uninstall OBS Drive” from the Start Menu group
      (if created by the installer).
